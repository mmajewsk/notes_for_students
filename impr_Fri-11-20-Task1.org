* Notes
What did we discussed during the labs:
- [ ] if name equals name
- [ ] don't print in the methods
- [ ] try to return stuff
- [ ] don't do small classes
- [ ] the class attribute is not the same thing as object attribute
- [ ] please don't use numpy next time and other libraries
- [ ] f'strings are okay but ...
- [ ] pep8 is the way to go
- [ ] comments - too much of them
- [ ] why not use static function or move it
- [ ] don't split everything into separate files

* Things to do for the improvement
** if __name__ == __main__
** use pep8
** put it in one file
** Car as classes - minimum 5 methods
** In while loop use something called generator (check what it is)
** Dont do print in methods
** logging instead of printing (use logging module)
** make good showcases
** extra points: do multiprocessing (it will not exceed 10/10 but you will be more sure that it will get 10/10)
** Events should be classes
** Environment class
